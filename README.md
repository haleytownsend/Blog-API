# Blog-API
Blog API challenge
Here are the requirements for this app:

Use npm init to initialize your project

Install uuid, which is a Node package that the blog post model will require, by running npm install uuid --save from within the root folder your folder for this project

Your app should support the four CRUD operations for a blog posts resource.

GET and POST requests should go to /blog-posts.

DELETE and PUT requests should go to /blog-posts/:id.

Use Express router and modularize routes to /blog-posts.

Add a couple of blog posts on server load so you'll automatically have some data to look at when the server starts.



Note that to create a new blog post, you need to supply a title, content, an author name, and (optionally) a publication date.
